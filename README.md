# I don't know Haskell

As part of my learning journey with Haskell, I've decided to _re-implement_ common functions.
Their initial implementation usually reflects the current state of my knowledge so expect them to be a bit rough. I may revisit them as my experience with the language increases.

# Disclaimer

I thought I'd share my journey with Haskell through this project. It has no pretention to be something useful for anyone else but me. Please don't use any of this, better solutions are probably out there.
